Turbopack build encountered 1 warnings:
./packages/db/src
Package @prisma/client can't be external
The request @prisma/client matches serverExternalPackages (or the default list).
The request could not be resolved by Node.js from the project directory.
Packages that should be external need to be installed in the project directory, so they can be resolved from the output files.
Try to install it into the project directory by running npm install @prisma/client from the project directory.
